## SQL

```sql
create table NAME (
FIXSTR varchar (maxlen) not null,
NUM numeric (totaldigits, decimalplaces),
primary key (...),
foreign key (...) references TABLE,
);
```

SQL Queries
 - `<column list>` : list of `<column>`, `<aggregator>(<column>)`, `COUNT(<query column list>)`
 - `<query column list> ::= [DISTINCT] <column list>`

```sql
SELECT <query column list>
FROM <table list>
[[INNER | [LEFT | RIGHT | FULL] OUTER] JOIN <table> ON <predicate>][WHERE ]
[GROUP BY <column list>][HAVING ]
[ORDER BY <column list with optional DESC/ASC's>][LIMIT ];
```
Aggregate functions include: sum, avg, count, min, max 
 - `GROUP BY` takes several rows and compresses them into one row 
 - `HAVING` is similar to where clause but is used in conjunction with a GROUP BY (it eliminates groups)
 - `WHERE` eliminates rows

Order of operations:
- `FROM `
- `ON`
- `OUTER`
- `WHERE`
- `GROUP BY`
- `HAVING`
- `SELECT`
- `DISTINCT`
- `ORDER BY`

nested and correlated (includes outer table) queries
- `IN`
- `EXISTS`
- `ALL`/`ANY`
- `NOT`; 3-value logic
- `UNION`/`INTERSECT`
- `IS [NOT] NULL`
- LIKE (% is .*), ~ (regex)

`Count(*)` actually counts all rows and `Count(column_name)` counts only the non-null elements.
This is a key distinction that you might want to pay attention to, though you could always add in a filter in the `WHERE` clause excluding nulls if you need it, and that helps with `count(*)`. 

## File Organization

bitmap (beginning of the page)

slot directory (end of the page)

at most how many records can fit = (page - footer)/(pointer+record)

## Performance Cost Model

 - $B$ - data blocks/page
 - $R$ - records/block
 - $D$ - avg time to r/w disk block
 - uniform random workloads
 - unit: IOs

clusted index with 2/3 full heap file pages, static index
 - scan all records, $B$, $B$, $3/2 B$
 - equality search (unique), $B/2$, $\log_2 B$,  $log_F 3/2 B + 1$
 - range search, $B$, $\log(B)+$pages, $\log_F(3/2 B) + $pages
 - insert, 2, ($\log(B) + B$), $(\log_F 3/2 B) + 2$
 - delete (unique), $(B/2+1)$, $(\log(B)+B)$, $(\log_f 3/2 B) + 2$

## Indices

## Buffers, Sorting/Hashing

 - IO cost = passes * $2N$ (<- read+write)
 - runs = $N/B$
 - buffer pages = $B$
 - input pages = $N$
 - passes = $1 \t{(sort)} + \t{ceil}(\log_{B-1} \t{runs}) \t{(merge)}$

## Joins

 - $\ntuples{R}$ - tuples in $R$
 - $\nblocks{R}$ - blocks in $R$
 - outer - $R$, inner - $S$

SNLJ
```pseudocode
for tuple r in R:
	for tuple s in S:
		if join_predicate(R, S):
			output(r, s)
```
Cost: $\ntuples{R} * \nblocks{S} + \nblocks{R}$

PNLJ (BNLJ with B=3)
```pseudocode
for page pr in R:
	for page ps in S:
		for tuple r in pr:
			for tuple s in ps:
				if join_predicate(R, S):
					output(r, s)
```
Cost: $\nblocks{R} * \nblocks{S} + \nblocks{R}$

BNLJ
```pseudocode
for block br in R:
	for page ps in S:
		for tuple r in br:
			for tuple s in ps:
				if join_predicate(R, S):
					output(r, s)
```
Cost: $\t{ceil}(\nblocks{R}/(B-2)) * \nblocks{S} + \nblocks{R}$

Which should be the larger table? inner, outer for BNLJ

INLJ
```pseudocode
for tuple r in R:
	matches = lookup(key(r))
	for tuple sj in matches:
		output(r, sj)
```
Cost: $\ntuples{R} * (\t{lookup cost}) + \nblocks{R}$

lookup cost = cost to traverse tree to leaf +
 - Alt 1: 0
 - Alt 2/3 clustered: 1 per matched page of $S$
 - Alt 2/3 unclustered: 1 per matched tuple of $S$

Sort-merge Join
 - Pass 0, …, $K-1$: externally sort $R$ and $S$
 - Pass $K$: merge $R$ and $S$
 - Average Case Cost = $Sort(R) + Sort(S) + \nblocks{R} + \nblocks{R}$ (cost to sort indexed is 0)
 - Need enough buffers to hold all runs of $R$ and $S$ in memory at the same time

Sort-merge Join Refinement
 - Pass 0, …, $K-2$: externally sort $R$ and $S$ until almost sorted
 - Pass $K-1$: merge $R$ and $S$

Grace hash join
 - $B$ Buffer Pages
 - create $B-1$ partitions
 - stop when either one of the 2 tables can be partitioned into $B-2$ page buffers
 - Any hash function used in the partitioning passes may NOT be used in the probing pass, since every value in a partition would have the same value for that hash function.
 - Cost: $(2P+1)(\nblocks{R} + \nblocks{S})$

Hybrid hashing becomes grace hash join when we don't have much memory, so cannot perform worse when we have very few buffer pages.

## Parallel Query Processing

Speedup - increased throughput, fixed workload (throughput(data size) $\in$ O(data size))

Scaleup - increased workload, fixed throughput (throughput(data size) $\in O(1)$)

Data Partitioning - Range (equijoins, range queries, group-by), Hash (equijoins, group-by), Round Robin (spreading load)

the disk and network I/O cost of one machine for performing a join?

Parallelizing Joins

P grace hash/sort merge join - only difference in cost is cost required to stream records to different machines (network cost is zero if no need to repartition)

Broadcast join

relation $R$ is very small - $\npages{R} * M$

Repartitioning cost/size of the records that has to be partitioned across machine phase for parallelized sort merge join: $(M-S)/M * [R]$

Key skew - If most of the data is of the same key, then range/hash partitioning will not improve performance!

## Query Optimization

Selectivity Estimation
- selectivity (reduction factor) estimation = |output| / |input|
- if indexed, we can assume we know number of distinct values and range
- $S(c = v) = 1/\abs{c}$
- $S(c_1 = c_2) = 1/\max(\abs{c_1}, \abs{c_2})$, NKeys(c)
- $S(c > v) = (\abs{(v,\max(c)]})/(\abs{[\min(c),\max(c))})$,
  - $\abs{(a,b]} = \abs{[a,b)} = b - a$
  - $\abs{[a,b]} = b - a + 1$ if int, $b - a$ if float
- $S(c < v) = (\abs{[\min(c),v)})/(\abs{[\min(c),\max(c)]})$,
- $S(p_1 \t{AND } p_2) = S(p_1)S(p_2)$
- $S(p_1 \t{OR } p_2) = S(p_1) + S(p_2) - S(p_1)S(p_2)$
- $S(\t{NOT } p) = 1 - S(p)$
- default, 1/10
- result size = $S(p) \npages{R}$

System R (Selinger) Optimizer
 - Single table access plans (Pass 1)
   - predicates on only one table will be handled in pass 1 of QO
   - Optimal access plan - full table scan, index scan if there is predicate etc. 
   - Interesting orders access plans (`GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `JOIN`)
   - Calculate the output size for next pass
 - Multi table joins (Pass 2)
   - Optimal join types between tables of previous pass with an additional table
   - Cost calculation is the same as joins in previous section!

Single-Table Plan Cost Estimates
- Sequential scan - $\npages{R}$
- Equality select on indexed key - height of index + 1
- Select on clustered index T - $(\npages{T} + \npages{R}) * \prod RFs$ <- selectivity of remaining subqueries
- Select on unclustered index T - $(\npages{T} + \ntuples{R}) * \prod RFs$
- exact - [# pages to leaf] + selectivity*[pages in relation]

- Plan Space
  - only left deep join trees
  - avoid cartesian products
  - push selections and joins
  - interesting orders
    - A relation is said to have an interesting order if it is in an `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, downstream `JOIN`

## Serializability, Transactions, & Concurrency Control

- Atomicity: All actions in transaction happen, or none
- Consistency: Transaction maintains database consistency
- Isolation: runs as if it is the only transaction
- Durability: Committed transactions persist

Two actions conflict if they are made by 
 - different transactions
 - on the same object
 - at least one of the actions is a write

 - Operation: logical unit
 - Transaction: sequence of operations
 - Schedule: some order in which we execute operations of a bunch of transactions
 - Serial schedule: each transaction runs start to finish without interleaving
 - For a pair of conflicting actions where T1 acts before T2, there is an edge in the dependency graph from T1 to T2
 - The schedule is conflict serializable if the dependency graph is acyclic
 - The conflict equivalent serial schedules can be found by topologically sorting the dependency graph
 - serial $\subset$ conflict serializable $\subset$ view serializable $\subset$ serializable $\subset$ schedules
