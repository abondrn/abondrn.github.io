Inspired by [a good idea from Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about), my "now" page gives you a rough idea of what I've been doing these past few months. It's what I'd tell a friend I hadn't seen for a year.

{%comment%} Where I live, where I work, what I'm working on. {%endcomment%}
This May, I joined Tempus Labs as a bioinformatics software engineer in Redwood Shores, CA. Having graduated less than a year ago, I still very much consider myself to be a new grad. Part of navigating post-grad life is deciding what to do with my newfound abundance of time and money, which I hope includes learning new skills and hobbies, networking, and just making the most of my 20s in general. 

Professionally, my interests lie in the life sciences, machine learning (esp. areas like natural language processing and active learning), scientific HCP, and embedded systems. In terms of applications, this includes bioinformatics, synthetic biology, wetlab automation, information augmentation for knowledge workers, ambient intelligence, philology, reactive art installations, the list goes on... One of my biggest priorities currently would be to return to grad school to pursue these areas. As such, some goals I have for the year and beyond include to gain research experience, get acquainted with exciting research directions and the groups working on them, and find mentors who might be able to help me get there.

In the past year, I took a road trip down to Santa Barbara, flew out to the Hawaiian island of Oahu, and spent some time as far north as Sea Ranch, CA. Having only recently upgraded from my iPhone 6S to the new 13 Pro model, I'd like to start posting photos of the interesting places I visit. Until then, I am active on Snapchat, Discord, and most recently Twitter.

{%comment%} What I'm focused on at this point in my life. {%endcomment%}
I'm getting back into reading books, not just my usual diet of bloggers. My chosen genres are philosophy, science fiction short stories, classic literature, and biographies.
