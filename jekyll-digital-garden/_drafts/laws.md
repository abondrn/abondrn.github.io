[There is a great deal of debate as to what actually constitutes a law of natures](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/laws-of-nature/), specifically if there are any strict laws or if they only apply [ceteris paribus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceteris_paribus), which is to say that there are many reasons why they may not hold in practice such as the interference of external systems. In my own personal definition, a law describes a relationship that holds between two quantities, while a rule describes optimal behavior under a given condition with [some amount of generality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_quantification).
