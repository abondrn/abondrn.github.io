Inspired by [a good idea from Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about), my "now" page gives you a rough idea of what I've been doing these past few months. It's what I'd tell a friend I hadn't seen for a year.

## What I'm working on
{%comment%} Where I live, where I work, what I'm working on. {%endcomment%}
Since May 2021, I have been working at Tempus Labs as a bioinformatics software engineer in Redwood Shores, CA. Part of navigating post-grad life is deciding what to do with my newfound abundance of time and money, which I hope includes learning new skills and hobbies, networking, and just making the most of my 20s in general. 

## Recent and upcoming travel
{% comment %}
In the past year, I took a road trip down to Santa Barbara, flew out to the Hawaiian island of Oahu, and spent some time as far north as Sea Ranch, CA.

After several years of little to no travel, I have spent the last few months working remotely from Montana and NYC -- polar opposites in terms of cultural geography. I don't have any major travel planned soon, but I will update this section when that changes!

## Follow what I'm up to

I escew social networks in favor of getting to know people on an individual bases, and try not to sync my contacts across apps. This site is a great way to keep up with me, but here are some of my profiles on other services you can follow. Let's keep each other accountable!
