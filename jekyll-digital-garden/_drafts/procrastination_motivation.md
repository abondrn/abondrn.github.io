### Procrastination Equation

![](https://alexvermeer.com/wp-content/uploads/howtogetmotivated-1440x900.png)

The procrastination = Expectancy x Value / Impulsiveness x Delay
- **Motivation** is self-explanatory; it’s basically the opposite of procrastination.
-   **Value** refers to how much you _enjoy doing_ a task, and how much you’ll _enjoy the reward_ from completing it.
	- You know it's low when...
		- Don’t know what you want
		- Too many different things to do (high I or low E)
		- Unclear priorities
		- The work is boring
		- The work is too difficult (low E or V)
		- Don’t actually support the goals/outcome of the project/task
	- To address:
		- Create competition
			- with yourself
			- with others 
			- inject fun
		- Find flow: match difficulty with skill
			- Too easy? make it harder
			- Too hard? make it easier
		- Find meaning:
			- How does this fit into longer term goals?
			- How is this connected to what you're passionate about? Is this intrinsically rewarding?
			- What are you not motivated to do? What are you avoiding? Use this to minimize aspects which are counterproductive
		- Find energy:
			- Splash cold water on your face
			- Plan around energy, not time 
			- Energize your environment (music)
			- Eat well
			- Get your blood pumping
		- Productive procrastination: what can you avoid by doing this?
-   **Expectancy** refers to how how much you _expect to succeed_ at doing the task, and how much you _expect to get_ the reward.
	- You know it's low when...
		- Lack of confidence in own abilities
		- Fear of failure
		- Fear of judgement
		- Don’t expect to get any recognition for completing this thing
	- To address:
		- Kill learned helplessness, cultivate a mindset
			- Lack of effort guarantees lack of success
			- Qualities and skills can be cultivated through effort
			- Nothing is carved in stone
		- Get inspired
		- Recognize success
		- Success spirals
			- Recognize small improvements as victories
			- Keep a daily log
			- Achieve one goal after another
		- Vicarious victory
			- Review your inspirations
		- Mental contrasting
			- Compare ideal state with current state 
			- Use visualization
-   **Impulsiveness** refers to your tendency to _get distracted_ and your ability to _stay focused_.
	- You know it's high when...
		- Can’t decide what to work on next
		- Keep getting distracted
		- Keep getting interrupted
		- Keep getting strong, intense cravings
	- To address:
		- Be "curious" about cravings -- mindfulness breaks the procrastination loop
		- Grow a new habit on top of an existing one
		- Take breaks, but no television!
		- Throw away the keys
		- Plan for the worst, hope for the best
			- What could go wrong?
			- Make a backup plan
		- Run a dash -- commit to only x minutes or y quantity
		- Accept your addiction
			- Don't trivialize "just one" 
			- Log your procrastination habits
		- Set external goal reminders
			- Read an inspiring quote
		- Track your progress visually
		- Make failure painful
			- Can you make a bet with someone?
			- Pair tempations with undesirable images
			- Imagine something negative that could result
-   **Delay** refers to the fact that the _further away_ a task’s _reward or completion_ is, the less motivated we will be. (hyperbolic discounting)
	- You know it's high when...
		- The project is too big/long
		- The reward is months away
	- To address:
		- Break down a large project into smaller deadlines 
		- Make consistent progress
		- Start small and early

One of the best ways: add acountability
- Who is someone you can tell about this?
- How can you make this public?

-   Evaluating
    -   Do you truly believe that pursuing this goal is important?
    -   Would you feel ashamed, guilty or anxious if you didn’t?
    -   How would your desire to pursue the goal change with circumstances, i.e. if it isn’t valued, doesn’t come with the same benefits, etc.
    -   Is the pursuit of this goal enjoyable, stimulating or satisfying?
