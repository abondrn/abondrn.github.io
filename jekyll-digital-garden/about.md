 - Welcome to my public-facing digital garden. You can think of it as a cross between a personal wiki, Twitter, and blog containing notes at various stages of completion. I welcome you to read and explore if you want to get to know me and my work better. Press the back arrow above to [[view my posts::/notes/]]. All views my own.

- I am a software engineer and a writer interested in the interplay between thoughts and constraints, the duality of interpretations and representations, and the nature of abstractions and correspondence between them. 

 - I am a long time practioner of Vipassana, but I am also a fallibilist with a slight objectivist bent. So I probably have a very different view of meditation than most people. We can talk about it if you want to.

- On this website I write articles about [[Computer Science::/tags/#Software]], [[Philosophy::/tags/#Philosophy]], Mathematics, and [[Generic Life Stuff::/tags/#General]]. Sometimes I also [[review::/tags/#Review]] books that I've read. You can find my programming side-projects on [[github::https://www.github.com/abondrn]]

 - I have a [[youtube channel::https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCESc8TaWpQxpHEnfhQLgzPQ]] on which I stream my work log(live writing sessions, coding sessions, reading/researching sessions, etc). %}

## Personal statement

 - I studied Computer Science at UC Berkeley. Aside from my major, I took coursework in data science, genetics, neuroscience, finance, and more.
 - Professionally, I enjoy working as a research engineer. I have years of industry experience in Data-Intensive System Design, mostly in the realm of tabular biomedical and unstructured textual data. In the past, I have also prototyped web and mobile apps, as well as backend APIs (see projects). In the future, I might be open to sales or forward-deployed engineering.
 - My interests lie in the life sciences, machine learning (esp. areas like natural language processing and active learning), scientific HCP, and embedded systems. In terms of applications, this includes bioinformatics, synthetic biology, wetlab automation, information augmentation for knowledge workers, ambient intelligence, digital humanities, reactive art installations... the list goes on
 - I am open to job, research, freelancing, volunteering, and collaboration opportunities.
